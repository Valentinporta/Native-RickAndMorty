# Native-RickAndMorty

I'm making this app to practice coding in React Native.
The features include:
- Tab Navigation (Home tab, search tab, and favorites list tab)
- Fetching and displaying data from a public API
- Stack navigation to display character info on clicking on a character (TODO)
- Light/Dark mode (TODO)
- Account creation, auth, localStorage || Enter as guest (No account info, no favs) (TODO)
