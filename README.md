# Native-RickAndMorty

I'm making this app to practice coding in React Native.
The features include:
- Fetching and displaying data from a public API
- Tab Navigation (Home tab, search tab, and favorites list tab)
- Stack navigation to display character info on clicking on a character
- Drawer navigation which stores the "Dark Mode" and "Log Out" buttons in a custom drawer header
- Light/Dark mode
- Account creation, auth with mail and password, Firestore Database for storing user info and list of favorites
